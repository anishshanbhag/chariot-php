			<div class="modal-body">
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">To provide food, which is safe, nutritious, and wholesome. We make efforts to understand customers requirements at every step, to ensure that we meet our customers expectations. We would like to get recognised nationally as a premium-quality wheat and other edible Agri products provider. We are poised to build a large number of happy customers across India by providing pure, unadulterated, and hygienically made wheat-based and other edible Agri products at a very reasonable price.

Our unique methodology of Chakki Atta milling and commitment to quality enables our customers to have new and improved products regularly. We at Chariot Agro Limited continuously make efforts to understand our customer requirements and match their expectations by our efficient quality management system. We review our achievements on a real time basis by defining the quality objectives, executing the required corrective and preventive actions and always adhering to the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>

With stringent testing procedures at every step of processing, production, packing and delivery, we achieve the desired quality of final products delivered to our customer.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Wheat Procurement</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">At Chariot Agro Limited, we strongly believe that wheat sourcing and procurement is most important activity and is the key to success in providing quality and nutrient products to our end customer. In India, premium quality wheat is produced in various states and wheat is largely sourced from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh etc. If needed, Chariot Agro Limited has also built capability to source premium quality wheat from countries like Australia, USA who produce wheat more than their consumption and who are keen to export wheat to India. Stringent quality checks are done before souring wheat and the wheat is tested for Gluten content, Sedimentation, Moisture, Unusable refraction, Hectolitre Weight, and Falling Number. The wheat grains are sourced only if the parameters are within the acceptable levels to ensure safe, hygienic, and nutrient end products.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Storage</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Wheat stocks are maintained throughout the year to ensure timely supply to end customer. Efficient and hygienic storage is critical to maintaining the consistency of end product. The wheat is stored based on the origin of product. The wheat is stored in the origin station and will be transported to milling location based on requirement. Separate lots are maintained for each lot of wheat purchased and first-in-first-out system is strictly followed. Stocks are regularly monitored and checked for any infestation and are regularly fumigated.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Milling</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Efficient milling requires two critical parameters â optimum moisture level and least possible foreign matter. We do repeated checks at regular intervals to make sure that these parameters are achieved.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Finished product testing - Pre-dispatch/Vehicle loading</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Products such as refined wheat flour (Maida) Semolina (Suji Rava) Chakki Atta, Chiroti Rava etc. are checked at regular intervals. Various tests such as Granularity, Moisture, Gluten, Filth test, Ash, Acid insoluble, SRC test, etc are carried out at a predefined frequency to test the consistency of the products. Our products are also tested in the laboratories to make sure that they meet the food safety standards before dispatch. The delivery vehicle is checked for any possible cross-contamination. We make sure that the food product is completely covered during transit. Hygiene and cleanliness of the vehicle are ensured before loading the finished product.</p>

				<p class="text_align"><strong>Whole Wheat chakki Atta Milling </strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Chariot Agro Limited is primarily engaged into procurement and processing of wheat products such as whole wheat Chakki Atta, Suji, Chiroti Rava and Maida. We process wheat in Chakki Atta plant which enables us to make superior quality whole wheat Chakki Atta. We use large hygienic storage facility to safely store wheat which enables us to secure stocks of premium varieties of wheat for safe handling and timely delivery of our products to our customers.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Storage</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Wheat grains are scientifically stored at warehouse and periodically fumigated to avoid infestation and preserve the natural qualities of grain. Wheat is stored at ambient temperature and away from direct sunlight and water.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Cleaning </strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Cleaning involves the separation of grain from other seeds & removal of materials like stones, dirt and chaffs accumulated during harvesting. Cleaning is done based on two principles, The average weight of the grain & the average size of the grain.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Conditioning</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">The cleaned wheat is ready to be conditioned for milling. The process is called Tempering, where the right amount of moisture is added to solidify the bran and tender the inner endosperm. Wheat is kept in the conditioning bins for almost 30 hours before it is milled.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Gristing</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Gristing means separating the chaff from the grain. This is the preliminary step in cleaning the wheat.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Milling</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Grains are passed through the grinding rolls to break them individually and then milled into flour in the stone mill. Wheat is reduced to flour in a repetitive process.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Packaging</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Flour is packed in Automatic packing machines that weigh the flour accurately and discharge it in laminate pouches and HDPE bag. The bag is then sealed with a stitching machine.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>Whole wheat chakki Atta Milling</strong></p>
				<p class="text_align">Whole wheat Chakki Atta Milling is also known as Stone Milling. The stone mill is one of the original mills used for grinding wheat which uses a combination of compression, shear, and abrasion. In whole wheat chakki atta milling, the final product is 96 % Atta and 4 % Bran and therefore, the product is more nutritious and tastier.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>1. STORAGE:</strong> We store wheat grains by maintaining the right amount of moisture, heat and air, which preserves the freshness and nutritive value.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>2. CLEANING: </strong>Cleaning involves the separation of grain from seeds and removal of other materials like stones, dirt and other seeds accumulated during wheat harvesting.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>3. CONDITIONING: </strong>The cleaned wheat is ready to be conditioned for milling. The process is called Tempering, where the moisture is added to solidify the bran and lender the inner endosperm.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>4. GRISTING: </strong>Gristing involves the blending of several classes of wheat until we obtain the desired quality of wheat flour.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>5. CHAKKI MILLING: </strong>Cleaned and tempered grains are ground between a stationary and a moving stone, discharging the resultant flour by the rotation motion and conveying out by the grooves and furrows in the stone.</p>
				<p class="text_align"><strong>6. PACKAGING:</strong> The final step is for the flour to pass into Fill, Form and Seal machine, and to be stored for freshness and goodness. The Product is packed in 1Kg and 5Kg laminate pouches and 20 Kg HDPE bags.</p>
